# ReThaumcraft
### This is my own try to port thaumcraft
- I will not use the original textures (exception particles and maybe aspects)
- There will be mechanics of 2 different thaumcrafts
  - Thaumcraft 4
  - Thaumcraft 6
- I also can take mechanics from addons
- I don't have permission, so it just project for me

## Showcase

## Additional features
- [ ] scan aspects from all items in chest on scan
- [ ] alloy smelter for brass
- [ ] custom alloy smelter (note: ignis crystal and inferno for second tier of heater and smelter)
