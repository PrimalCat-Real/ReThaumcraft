# ReThaumcraft
### This is my own try to port thaumcraft
- I will not use the original textures (exception particles and maybe aspects)
- There will be mechanics of 2 different thaumcrafts
  - Thaumcraft 4
  - Thaumcraft 6
- I can also take mechanics from addons

## Main Priority
- [ ] Config System
- [ ] LoadStone, Jei, Curios, GekoLib dependency 
- [ ] Items aspects
- [ ] Entities aspects
- [ ] Fluids aspects
- [ ] Player aspects capacity
- [ ] Thaumometer
- [ ] Aspects nodes
- [ ] Thamomicon
- [ ] Researchers
