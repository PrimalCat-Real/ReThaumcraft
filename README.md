# ReThaumcraft
### This is my own try to port thaumcraft
- I will not use the original textures (exception particles and maybe aspects)
- There will be mechanics of 2 different thaumcrafts
  - Thaumcraft 4
  - Thaumcraft 6
- I also can take mechanics from addons
- I don't have permission, so it just project for me
